## What to expect?

Seriously, who still writes blogs in 2021? Isn't that more like an early 2000s thing? I tried and gave up on this a while back already. Still, every now and again this urge to go on the internet and rant about stuff I experience in my daily work life itches me in the back of my head. 

"If you want to rant, why don't you go on social media?" you might think. Blogs are for informative content, right? Why don't I join in on the angry mob on the web?

Well... I don't like being angry. I don't like ranting without reflecting. So let me attempt to keep my rants reflective and informative, both for the sake of my mental well being and as well as your entertainment and professional horizon. 

Strap on your seat belts - it's going to be a bumpy ride >:-)
